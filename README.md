## ABSTRACT
Fashion AI-based mixed-initiative co-creative systems (AI-MICCS) have been developed to enhance the creativity of fashion designers. Many studies have attempted to identify the situations in which the AI or the human takes the initiative while using the system. However, such studies often rely on subjective user evaluations, such as surveys and interviews, which can limit an objective understanding of user behavior. The lack of consideration of the entire fashion design process also limits the ability to provide comprehensive insights into the distribution of initiative across all design phases. Therefore, we combined log analysis with subjective evaluation methods to determine who should take the initiative in different phases of the fashion design process. To this end, we conducted a user study with 30 fashion designers, using CoCoStyle, a software designed to support three fashion design processes (Research, Design, and Improvement). We found that, in the Research phase, the AI should take the initiative by providing information that aligns with the user's style. In the Design phase, the user should take the initiative by modifying designs according to his or her preferences. In the Improvement phase, both AI and humans should take the initiative because they need to share feedback and interact. Based on the study, we propose design implications of initiative allocation within human-AI collaboration systems, aiming to further improve user satisfaction during human-AI collaboration.
