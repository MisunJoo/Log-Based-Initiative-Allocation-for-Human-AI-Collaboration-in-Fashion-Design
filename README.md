## ABSTRACT
Fashion AI-based mixed-initiative co-creative systems (AI-MICCS) have been developed to enhance the creativity of fashion designers. Many studies have aimed to determine when AI and humans take the initiative in leading the system. However, such studies often rely on subjective assessments from users, such as surveys and interviews, which can limit an objective understanding of user behavior. The lack of consideration for the entire fashion design process also limits to provide comprehensive insights into the distribution of initiative throughout all phases. Therefore, we combined log analysis with subjective methods to determine who should take the initiative in each phase of the fashion design process. To this end, we conducted a user study with 30 fashion designers, using CoCoStyle which supports three fashion design process (Research, Design, and Improvement). We identified that, in the Research phase, AI should take the initiative by providing information that aligns with the user's style. In the Design phase, the user should take the initiative by modifying designs according to their preferences. In the Improvement phase, as feedback is important, both AI and humans should take the initiative. Based on the study, we propose design implications of initiative allocation within Human-AI co-creativity systems, aiming to further enhance user satisfaction during Human-AI collaboration.
